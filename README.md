- [apollo-server-express] - `apollo-server-express` is the Apollo Server package for [Express](https://expressjs.com/), the most popular Node.js web framework. It enables you to attach a GraphQL server to an existing Express server.
-  [nodemon] - nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

-  [mongoose] - Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
